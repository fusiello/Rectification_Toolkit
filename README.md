#Epipolar Rectification Toolkit

### Andrea Fusiello, 2020

This toolkit is a collection of Matlab functions implementing
epipolar rectification both in the calibrated and uncalibrated
case.  It requires functions contained in the [Computer Vision
Toolkit]
(http://www.diegm.uniud.it/fusiello/demo/toolkit/ComputerVisionToolkit.zip)
by the same author and the [VLfeat toolbox] (http://www.vlfeat.org)
by A. Vedaldi, for the SIFT implementation.

After installing the abovementioned dependencies, cd to the
toolkit main directory and type `runMe`.

The `rectify()` function contained here calls either
`rectifyP()` (calibrated) or `rectifyF()` (uncalibrated) according to
the case. Then it calls `imrectify()` which perforn the image
warping and takes care of bounding boxes and centering.

Please note that the functions: `rectifyP(), rectifyF(),
imrectify()` are *not* contained in this toolkit as they are now
part of the [Computer Vision Toolkit]
(http://www.diegm.uniud.it/fusiello/demo/toolkit/ComputerVisionToolkit.zip).

The data is in the `examples` folder. It should be easy to
replace it with your own images. The 3x4 camera matrix
is contained in a text file with extension `.pm`.

While in the calibrated case results are always correct, 
in the uncalibrated case they depend on the matches computed
by RANSAC and on the success of the non-linear minimization.  
As a consequence, results are not guaranteed may differ from
run to run.
